      <h2>The History of Loud</h2>
      <p>
        "Loud" started out as a little drawing in the corner of a notepad on one of those peaceful days when your thoughts are free to roam.
         Slowly, what began as a single sketch developed into a narrative about emotion, identity, and finding strength in the midst of turmoil. 
         Loud served as both my creative release and a means of using comics to convey a more profound, poignant tale. It was inspired by city life, anime, and my own experiences. 
         After several coffee runs, late nights, and digital rewrites, I can now honestly say that I'm proud of it.
