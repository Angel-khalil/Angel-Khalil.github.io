      <h2>The History of Loud</h2>
      <p>
        "Loud" began as a small sketch in the corner of a notebook during one of those quiet afternoons where your mind wanders.
        What started as a single drawing slowly evolved into a story—one about identity, emotion, and finding strength in chaos. 
        Inspired by city life, anime, and personal experience, Loud became my creative outlet and a way to tell a deeper, emotional story through comics. 
        Countless late nights, coffee runs, and digital rewrites later, it’s become something I’m truly proud to share.

      <h2>What is Loud About?</h2>
      <p>
        "Loud" follows the life of a teenage boy adjusting to life in a bustling city with his single mother. 
        Things seem normal enough—school, friendship, and weekend concerts—until one night changes everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a concert, Loud and his best friend Wayne get cornered in an alley while heading to the subway. 
        The mugging triggers something inside Loud—an ability he never knew he had, one tied deeply to his emotions and mental state. 
        His powers are unpredictable, raw, and constantly evolving. Now, he must navigate not just the chaos of high school, 
        but a power that grows louder with every feeling he suppresses.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s a story about emotion, growth, friendship, and learning to live with the noise inside your head.
